# Smart Contract

The MediCare platform utilizes a smart contract deployed on the Sepolia testnet for handling access control. This contract is crucial for managing permissions within the platform.

## Contract Deployment

The contract is deployed using Remix IDE, a simplified tool for deploying smart contracts over the blockchain.

### Steps for Deployment

1. **Prepare for Deployment**: 
    - Paste the smart contract code into Remix IDE.
    - Follow the deployment steps as shown in this walkthrough video: [https://youtu.be/I_OZd0HN7ro?feature=shared](https://youtu.be/I_OZd0HN7ro?feature=shared).

2. **Obtain Testnet ETH**:
    - To perform transactions on the Sepolia testnet, obtain testnet ETH from this faucet: [https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/](https://sepolia-faucet.pk910.de/). Note that receiving tokens might take time, but staying longer on the page increases the amount received.

3. **Deploy the Contract**:
    - After setting up in Remix IDE and obtaining testnet ETH, deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet.

4. **Store Contract Address**:
    - Post-deployment, make sure to note down the contract address for future reference.

This setup ensures that the MediBlock platform has a robust mechanism for access control, leveraging blockchain technology for enhanced security and trust.
